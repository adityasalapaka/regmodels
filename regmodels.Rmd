# Reproducible Research, Course Project
The objective is to explore the relationship between a set of variables and MPG,
and attempt to answer the following questions:

* “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?”

* "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

## About The Dataset
The `mtcars` dataset was extracted from the 1975 Motor Trend US magazine, and
comprises fuel consumption and ten aspects of automobile design and performance
for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models).
